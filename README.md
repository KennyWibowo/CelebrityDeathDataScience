# Celebrity Death Data Science

For many on the internet, it seemed as though 2016 was a particularly awful year due to the deaths of many beloved actors, musician, and other celebrities. However, it may not actually be the case that 2016 had an unusually high number of celebrity deaths. Snopes examined the number of notable deaths reported by various news outlets in 2016 and in previous years and saw that while several news outlets reported more deaths in 2016 than in other years, the differences were not unusually high. This also does not necessarily mean than more celebrities are dying but rather it could be that news outlets are reporting more celebrity deaths in recent years. According to The Guardian, social media has contributed in amplifying emotional response after a celebrity death due to the speed at which news travels on these websites and apps as well as social media bringing people closer to the celebrities they adore. Time Magazine suggests that it is not the number of celebrity deaths that made 2016 unusual but rather the fact that many of the celebrities that passed away were particularly notable, which makes it seem like 2016 was worse than previous years.

The Telegraph also discusses some theories about why so many celebrities seemed to die in 2016. It could be that more people are dying in general or more people are being considered celebrities. It is also possible that many celebrities had unhealthy lifestyles that ultimately contributed to their untimely deaths. People’s perceptions could also have been affected due to celebrities dying on the same day or within days of each other. We also once again get the theory that social media amplifies celebrity deaths.

BBC ran an article regarding the pre-prepared orbituries for their radio and tv shows and saw a huge spike in the trend in the number of orbituries being prepared. BBC seemed to look into the social media aspect and if the numbers matched the spike on the social media trend. BBC created more pre-prepared orbituries in 2016 then they had combined from 2013-2015.

For our project, we will be examining the social media theory in particular. Since we get news spreads almost instantly through social media platforms and these platforms provide millions of people a place to express their emotions, it is quite plausible that social media has skewed people’s perceptions regarding the number of celebrity deaths.

In other words, our main question is this: What is the total number of significant celebrities that passed away in 2016, compared to other years? How has social media impacted our bias of noting these deaths? We propose that that although it may be true that a significant number of celebrities passed away in 2016, the introduction of modern media, especially through social mediums such as Facebook and Reddit, has caused a sense of “over sensationalization” that biased our judgement of how many celebrities passed away in 2016 compared to other years.
