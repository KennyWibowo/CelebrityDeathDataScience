    "For many on the internet, it seemed as though 2016 was a particularly awful year due to the deaths of many beloved actors, musician, and other celebrities. However, it may not actually be the case that 2016 had an unusually high number of celebrity deaths. Snopes examined the number of notable deaths reported by various news outlets in 2016 and in previous years and saw that while several news outlets reported more deaths in 2016 than in other years, the differences were not unusually high. This also does not necessarily mean than more celebrities are dying but rather it could be that news outlets are reporting more celebrity deaths in recent years. According to The Guardian, social media has contributed in amplifying emotional response after a celebrity death due to the speed at which news travels on these websites and apps as well as social media bringing people closer to the celebrities they adore. Time Magazine suggests that it is not the number of celebrity deaths that made 2016 unusual but rather the fact that many of the celebrities that passed away were particularly notable, which makes it seem like 2016 was worse than previous years.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Telegraph also discusses some theories about why so many celebrities seemed to die in 2016. It could be that more people are dying in general or more people are being considered celebrities. It is also possible that many celebrities had unhealthy lifestyles that ultimately contributed to their untimely deaths. People’s perceptions could also have been affected due to celebrities dying on the same day or within days of each other. We also once again get the theory that social media amplifies celebrity deaths.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our project, we will be examining the social media theory in particular. Since we get news spreads almost instantly through social media platforms and these platforms provide millions of people a place to express their emotions, it is quite plausible that social media has skewed people’s perceptions regarding the number of celebrity deaths.\n",

    "*Data Cleaning (2-3 sentences)*\n",
    "Although most of the data seems to be in a common format, we’ve observed some inconsistencies in the way death is recorded between Wikipedia pages. For example, some pages record death in a “Born: xxx, Died: xxx” format, while others are formatted in a timeline, such as “xxx - xxx”. For the trending information, it isn’t in a common unit, but instead in relative “trendiness,” so in order to collect the data, we will pick an arbitrary pivot point that we will use to compare to the rest of the celebrities. (Ex: A is 100%, B is 80% of A, C is 120% of A.)\n",

    "*Data Analysis (1-2 paragraphs)*\n",
    "Since our data is in a fairly straightforward format (binary, either dead or not dead, and on specific dates), no transformations will be necessary.

We will then report the number and trends in 2016 in order to compare and see if the year is a true outlier or a perceived outlier along with an additional statistical analysis of the given datasets.\n",

Due to celebrities being public figures, it is unlikely that we would encounter any additional privacy issues due the data being dependent on social media trends and their deaths."

    "   If our analysis and hypothesis is correct, this can be potentially another indicative trend on how impactful social media usage as well as groupthink can cause individuals to see outlying trends when there is none. This project could also supplement other research regarding the usage of social media and the internet over the past decade. If our methods fail to gather significant data to determine any conclusions then we might need to modify how the data is grouped or compiled before applying analyses. If our hypothesis is wrong, this implies that there were an inordinate amount of celebrity deaths in 2016 and that the social media trends were possibly correct. This could additionally be used for evidence that social media allows the public to be aware of sometimes accurate statistical trends in society.\n",
    "\n",
    "   It is possible that what constitutes a “celebrity” might vary from person to person. This can potentially cause our data to become more confusing as some of the deaths contributing to the dataset might not lead to substantial social media trends compared to other deaths. This could skew that data in that the deaths in a year were notable, but not well-known to American media and public. Additionally, we need to consider regional social media trends in other countries. Not doing so might potentially lead us to assume that there was no trend for that celebrity when there actually could be."
